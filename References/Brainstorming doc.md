I want to create a web app Fireflies clone. This web app will have a stripped down functionality of Fireflies (an ai meeting transcriber/ notetaker). Required functionality includes being able to record using the device’s microphone, and automatically convert the audio recording into a text transcript. Sign in/ account creation functionality is not required, nor is being able to record multiple meetings (only a single recording per session is sufficient). The user should be able to enter their email address to send a copy of the transcript to themselves. The landing page should be titled “Create trips by chatting with your friends”, and should allow the user to hit the “record” button to start the recording process. There should also be a text section where the questions that the users will discuss during the call will be detailed. In addition, there needs to be a mechanism where we can store all chat transcripts generated from this web app. We do not need the audio files, but the chat transcript will be needed for us to refine future versions of the product
