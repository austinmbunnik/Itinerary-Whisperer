## 🔍 Test Coverage

### **Happy Path Scenarios** ✓
1. Upload valid audio file → Job created
2. Job processes → Status updates to "processing"
3. Whisper API call → Transcript generated
4. Job completes → Status "completed" with transcript
5. Cost calculated → Usage tracked
6. Results retrievable → Client gets transcript + cost

### **Error Scenarios** ✓
1. No file uploaded → 400 error
2. Invalid file format → 400 error with format list
3. File too large → 413 error
4. Invalid job ID → 404 error
5. API rate limits → Retry with backoff
6. Network errors → Automatic retry
7. Conversion failures → Proper error propagation

### **Edge Cases** ✓
1. Multiple concurrent uploads → Rate limiting
2. Very short audio files → Minimum cost calculation
3. Budget threshold exceeded → Alert logging
4. FFmpeg not available → Graceful degradation
5. Missing audio duration → File size estimation
